# that are true. The logical operator "&" makes two logicals true only when they 
# are both true.
 
Code
# defining murder rate as before
murder_rate <- murders$total / murders$population * 100000
# creating a logical vector that specifies if the murder rate in that state is 
# less than or equal to 0.71

index <- murder_rate <= 0.71
# determining which states have murder rates less than or equal to 0.71
murders$state[index]
# calculating how many states have a murder rate less than or equal to 0.71
sum(index)

# creating the two logical vectors representing our conditions
west <- murders$region == "West"
safe <- murder_rate <= 1
# defining an index and identifying states with both conditions true
index <- safe & west
murders$state[index]

# 2.13.3 which
ind <- which(murders$state == "California")
murder_rate[ind]

# 2.13.4 match
#to find out the murder rates for several states, say New York, Florida, and 
# Texas, we can use the function match. This function tells us which indexes 
# of a second vector match each of the entries of a first vector:

ind <- match(c("New York", "Florida", "Texas"), murders$state)
ind

# Now we can look at the murder rates:
murder_rate[ind]

# 2.13.5 %in%
# If rather than an index we want a logical that tells us whether or not each 
# element of a first vector is in a second, we can use the function %in%.
c("Boston", "Dakota", "Washington") %in% murders$state

#Advanced: There is a connection between match and %in% through which. 
# To see this, notice that the following two lines produce the same index 
# (although in different order):

match(c("New York", "Florida", "Texas"), murders$state)
which(murders$state%in%c("New York", "Florida", "Texas"))

# 3.2. Exercises 
murders <- mutate(murders, rate =  total / population * 100000, rank = (-rate))
# in the solution to the previous exercise we did the following:
  
# Created a table 
my_states <- filter(murders, region %in% c("Northeast", "West") & rate < 1)

# Used select to show only the state name, the murder rate and the rank
select(my_states, state, rate, rank)

# The pipe %>% permits us to perform both operation sequentially and without 
# having to define an intermediate variable my_states. For example we could 
# have mutated and selected in the same line like this:
  
mutate(murders, rate =  total / population * 100000, rank = (-rate)) %>% 
select(state, rate, rank)

# 4.2 PROGRAMMING BASICS: CONDITIONALS

# Key Points

# The most common conditional expression in programming is an if-else statement,
# which has the form "if [condition], perform [expression], else perform 
# [alternative expression]".
# The ifelse() function works similarly to an if-else statement, but it is 
# particularly useful since it works on vectors by examining each element of the 
# vector and returning a corresponding answer accordingly.
# The any() function takes a vector of logicals and returns true if any of the 
# entries are true.
# The all() function takes a vector of logicals and returns true if all of the 
# entries are true.

#Code
# an example showing the general structure of an if-else statement
a <- 0
if(a!=0){
  print(1/a)
} else{
  print("No reciprocal for 0.")
}

# an example that tells us which states, if any, have a murder rate less than 0.5
library(dslabs)
data(murders)
murder_rate <- murders$total / murders$population*100000
ind <- which.min(murder_rate)
if(murder_rate[ind] < 0.5){
  print(murders$state[ind]) 
} else{
  print("No state has murder rate that low")
}

# changing the condition to < 0.25 changes the result
if(murder_rate[ind] < 0.25){
  print(murders$state[ind]) 
} else{
  print("No state has a murder rate that low.")
}

# the ifelse() function works similarly to an if-else conditional
a <- 0
ifelse(a > 0, 1/a, NA)

# the ifelse() function is particularly useful on vectors
a <- c(0,1,2,-4,5)
result <- ifelse(a > 0, 1/a, NA)

# the ifelse() function is also helpful for replacing missing values
data(na_example)
no_nas <- ifelse(is.na(na_example), 0, na_example) 
sum(is.na(no_nas))

# the any() and all() functions evaluate logical vectors
z <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
any(z)
all(z)

# 4.3 Basic Functions
# Key points
# The R function, called function() tells R you are about to define a new function.
# Functions are objects, so must be assigned a variable name with the arrow 
# operator. The general way to define functions is: (1) decide the function name,
# which will be an object, (2) type function() with your function's arguments in
# parentheses, (3) write all the operations inside brackets.
# Variables defined inside a function are not saved in the workspace.

# Code
# example of defining a function to compute the average of a vector x
avg <- function(x){
  s <- sum(x)
  n <- length(x)
  s/n
}

# we see that the above function and the pre-built R mean() function are identical
x <- 1:100
identical(mean(x), avg(x))

# variables inside a function are not defined in the workspace
s <- 3
avg(1:10)
s

# the general form of a function
# my_function <- function(VARIABLE_NAME){
  # perform operations on VARIABLE_NAME and calculate VALUE
  VALUE
# }

# functions can have multiple arguments as well as default values
avg <- function(x, arithmetic = TRUE){
  n <- length(x)
  ifelse(arithmetic, sum(x)/n, prod(x)^(1/n))
}

x

# 4.4. FOR-LOOPS
# Key points
# For-loops perform the same task over and over while changing the variable.  
# They let us define the range that our variable takes, and then changes the
# value with each loop and evaluates the expression every time inside the loop.
# The general form of a for-loop is: "For i in [some range], do operations".  
# This i changes across the range of values and the operations assume i is a 
# value you're interested in computing on.
# At the end of the loop, the value of i is the last value of the range.

# Code
# creating a function that computes the sum of integers 1 through n
compute_s_n <- function(n){
  x <- 1:n
  sum(x)
}

# a very simple for-loop
 for(i in 1:5){
  print(i)
 }
  # a for-loop for our summation
  m <- 25
  s_n <- vector(length = m) # create an empty vector
  for(n in 1:m){
    s_n[n] <- compute_s_n(n)
  }
  
  # creating a plot for our summation function
  n <- 1:m
  plot(n, s_n)
  
  # a table of values comparing our function to the summation formula
  head(data.frame(s_n = s_n, formula = n*(n+1)/2))
  
  # overlaying our function with the summation formula

# ggplot2 geometries
# Barplots

# We often already have a table with a distribution that we want to present as a barplot. 
# Here is an example of such a table:

data(murders)
tab <- murders %>% 
  count(region) %>% 
  mutate(proportion = n/sum(n))
tab

# We no longer want geom_bar to count, but rather just plot a bar to the height provided
# by the proportion variable. For this we need to provide x (the categories) and y 
# (the values) and use the stat="identity" option.

tab %>% ggplot(aes(region, proportion)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity")

# HISTOGRAMS

heights %>% 
  filter(sex == "Female") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(height)) + 
  geom_histogram()

# If we run the code above, it gives us a message:
  
  # stat_bin() using bins = 30. Pick better value with binwidth.

# We previously used a bin size of 1 inch, so the code looks like this:
  
  heights %>% 
  filter(sex == "Female") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(height)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)

  
# Finally, if for aesthetic reasons we want to add color, we use the arguments described in the help file. We also add labels and a title:
  
  heights %>% 
    filter(sex == "Female") %>% 
    ggplot(aes(height)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "blue", col = "black") +
    xlab("Male heights in inches") + 
    ggtitle("Histogram")
  

# 8.16.3 Density plots geom_density
# To create a smooth density, we use the geom_density. To make a smooth density plot with the data previously shown as a histogram we can use this code:
    
    heights %>% 
    filter(sex == "Female") %>%
    ggplot(aes(height)) +
    geom_density()
# To fill in with color, we can use the fill argument.
  
  heights %>% 
    filter(sex == "Female") %>%
    ggplot(aes(height)) +
    geom_density(fill="blue")
  
  
# To change the smoothness of the density, we use the adjust argument to multiply the 
# default value by that adjust. For example, if we want the bandwidth to be twice as big we use:
  
  heights %>% 
    filter(sex == "Female") %>%
    ggplot(aes(height)) +
    geom_density(fill="blue", adjust = 2)

  
# 8.16.5 QQ-plots
# For qq-plots we use the geom_qq geometry. From the help file, we learn that we need to specify the sample (we will learn about samples in a later chapter). Here is the qqplot for men heights.
  
  heights %>% filter(sex=="Male") %>%
    ggplot(aes(sample = height)) +
    geom_qq()  
  
# Order categories by a meaningful value
  data(murders)

# 5.2 Data Visualization Principles, Part 2  Show the Data
# This brings us to our first principle: show the data. This simple ggplot2 code already generates a more informative plot than the barplot by simply showing all the data points:
  
  heights %>%

#  we point out two ways we can improve a plot showing all the points.The first is to 
# add jitter, which adds a small random shift to each point.
# To add jitter, use the  geom_jitter() geometry instead of geom_point()

  heights %>%

# Question 2: Demographics of Titanic Passengers
# combinations of faceting, alpha blending, stacking and using variable counts on the 
# y-axis

# proportions differ slightly across ages and there are more males than females.

# A stacked density plot with count on the y-axis is useful for answering B, C and D. 
# The main mode is around age 25 and a second smaller mode is around age 4-5. 
# There are more males than females as indicated by a higher total area and higher counts 
# at almost all ages. With count on the y-axis, it is clear that more males than females
# are age 40.

# males than females for ages 18-35, approximately the same proportion of males and females 
#age 35-55, and a higher proportion of males over age 55. The oldest individuals are male.

# using geom_bar(). Try plotting one variable and filling by the other variable. 
# You may want to try the default plot, then try adding position = position_dodge() to 
# geom_bar() to make separate bars for each group.
# You can read more about making barplots in the textbook section on ggplot2 geometries.

# Which of the following are true?
# Less than half of passengers survived.

# Question 6: Survival by Fare
# Filter the data to remove individuals who paid a fare of 0.

# Which of the following are true?
